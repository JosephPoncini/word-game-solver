// This is an app that helps users solve to classic mobile word games: Word Hunt (similar to Boggle) and Wordle. Site calls on a backend I developed in Python which for word hunt, finds all possible words and for wordle, finds all possible words and gives a "best" word for a given wordle board. Best in this case is the word which has the best worst case scenerio (ie. the scenerio in which it eliminates the least amount words possible is better than the equivalent scenerio for any other word that is a possible solution)

// UPDATES

// July 6, 2024 - Wordle Solver page is functioning. Word Hunt still needs to be implemented
